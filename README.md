# Pirhana
Blood in the water.

Made with love.

The purpose of pirhana is attact phishing attempts and robocalls to a contact list of one or more identities. The intended workflow is to use the crawl option to generate a list of urls to forms that accept email addresses. Kill the process with ctl+C when you've had enough waiting. The "signup" option will make a best-effort attempt to fill out forms with contact information in a contacts.csv file. Use the "entry" option to create that list.

Sit back and wait for spam and links to malware. It's like dropping blood in the water around pirhanas, get it?

Needless to say, you should not use your primary email account and personal information for this.
